## Idris 2 highlighting for Sublime Text

Sublime Text [syntax highlighting](idris2.sublime-syntax) for [Idris 2](https://www.idris-lang.org/) programming language.
This was mainly created to be usable with [`bat`](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/), [`typst`](https://typst.app/),
[`delta`](https://github.com/dandavison/delta) and etc.

## Panydocy theme

[This theme](panydocy-light.tmTheme) makes code to look similarly to the default code theme of [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).
The theme looks especially good for the Idris 2 programming language with the provided syntax highlighting.

[A dark variant](panydocy-dark.tmTheme) of the same theme exists, it builds on the same principles, but uses different colours.

You can look at a [usage example](example.typ) using the provided `typst` document.
